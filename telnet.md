Make a telnet game

1. Instead of using console directly from Main, create and use: ConsoleRenderer, TelnetRenderer and something related to use shared text from both class (TextRenderer)
2. Always use ConsoleRenderer, add menu entry to start a server (don't forget about port settings)
3. Create rooms to allow more than 2 players

### Local JAR menu example

```
TicTacToe (Local)

1) 2 players, 1 screen
2) Start server
```

### Telnet client menu example

```
TicTacToe (Online)

1) 2 players, 1 screen
2) 2 players (online)
```
